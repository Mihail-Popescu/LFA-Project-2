## Overview
This project was developed for the **"Limbaje Formale și Automate"** (Formal and Automated Languages) course. It is a web application that allows users to create and edit graphs, including nodes and edges. Each node and edge can have a key-value pair associated with it, enabling the representation of complex relationships and attributes.

For example, the application can be used to model a road network between cities:
- **Nodes** represent cities and have attributes such as name (label), population (title) and id.
- **Edges** represent roads and have attributes such as name (label), length (title), from(id) and to(id).

The visualization is powered by the **Vis.js** library, which provides an interactive and dynamic way to display and manipulate the graph.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- **Visual Studio 2022** (with the ASP.NET Core workload installed).
- **.NET 7 SDK** (you will be prompted to install it when loading the project if it’s not already installed).
